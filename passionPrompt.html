    <h1>Social Injustice</h1>
        <h3>Why i am passionate about Social Injustice.</h3>
        <h4>How i was introduced?</h4>
            <p>I was introduced to this ever since i was young. Going to school with other hispanics and african americans you see/hear how they are treated just for being themselves and can’t do anything about it. In history class we were taught about how historic figures fought for colored people’s rights.</p>
        <h4>Who served as an inspiration?</h4>
            <p>Many activists such as Martin luther king fought for rights so that everyone can have an equal chance. Rosa parks didn’t give up her seat, montgomery bus boycott stood to racial segregation, Dolores Cacungo fought for the “poor” having the same education as the “rich” etc. so many people have fought for the social injustices</p>
        <h4>Who continues to ispire me today?</h4>
            <p>So many people have fought for the social injustices People that continue to inspire me are the people who fight the blm movement, people who have protests/movements to fight for the minorities rights is very inspiring.
